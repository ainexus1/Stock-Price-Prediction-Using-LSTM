# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

## Description

This project implements a stock price prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model is trained on historical stock prices to learn patterns and trends, and then it predicts future stock prices.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- pandas
- pandas_datareader
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- keras

## Acknowledgments
- The project uses the TensorFlow and Keras libraries for building and training the LSTM model.
- Stock price data is fetched using pandas_datareader.
- Various preprocessing techniques, including standardization, are applied to the data.
